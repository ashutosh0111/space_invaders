# Space Invader Remake

![Space Invader Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This project is a remake of the classic Space Invader game using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The game incorporates various modern elements while staying true to the original gameplay. You'll find features like spaceship tilting, invaders firing back, and dynamic blast animations that enhance the gaming experience.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to control the spaceship at the bottom of the screen and eliminate all incoming waves of invaders. The invaders move horizontally and gradually descend, getting faster as their numbers decrease. The spaceship can be moved left or right using the arrow keys, and it can fire projectiles towards the invaders.

But watch out! The invaders won't go down without a fight. Some of them will fire projectiles back at your spaceship. Be sure to dodge these incoming shots to stay in the game.

## Features

- **Spaceship Tilting:** The spaceship tilts slightly based on its movement direction, adding a realistic touch to the game dynamics.

- **Invaders Firing Back:** The invaders retaliate by occasionally firing their own projectiles towards your spaceship. Stay alert and maneuver to avoid getting hit.

- **Dynamic Blast Animations:** Enjoy visually satisfying blast animations when projectiles collide with invaders or the spaceship.
